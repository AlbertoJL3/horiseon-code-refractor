# Code Refractor 
The goal is to clean up the HTML and CSS code by making sure semantic elements are being used.
## Description
Cleaning up the code is not the only purpose of the code refraction, making it more accessible through "alt" attributes is also a priority. 
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
