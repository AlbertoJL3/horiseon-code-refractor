# Code Refractor 
The site for a marketing agency has a lot of repeating code. The goal is to clean up the HTML and CSS code by making sure semantic elements are being used in order to help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO).  
## Description
Cleaning up the code is not the only purpose of the code refraction, making it more accessible through "alt" attributes is also a priority. The site should look exactly the same and must be entirely functional after all semantic elements have been added. Better accessibility and semantic element usage will help with the SEO. 
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
